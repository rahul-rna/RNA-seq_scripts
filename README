Use coverage_curves_PE.pl along with SAM file generated by a read-mapping program to create a 2-column text file that shows the number of reads mapped to each nucleotide position on each strand. This file along with a genbank file can be used in Artemis browser to visualize RNA-seq peaks that corresponds to transcripts. See examples in PMID: 21665928, PMID: 25601101.
