Use coverage_curves_PE.pl along with a SAM file generated by a read-mapping program (e.g., BWA, Bowtie2) to create a 2-column text file that shows the number of reads mapped to each nucleotide position on each strand. This file along with a genbank file can be used in Artemis genome browser to visualize RNA-seq peaks that correspond to transcripts. See examples in PMID: 21665928, PMID: 25601101.
